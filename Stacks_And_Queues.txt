Exercises
For exercises requiring code, you are free to use the language of your choice.


1. What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?

A:

A stack implements a Last in, First Out priority and a Queue implements a First In, First Out priority

2. What are the similarities between stacks and queues?

A:

both data structures add elements at the end of the array. In Javascript, it can be done by array.prototype.push().

3.Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options 
in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?

A:

The UNDO function would follow a Last In, First Out data structure. The ranking of tasks requires that the most 
recent event triggered by the user be the first one to get 'Undone'.

The REDO function implements a FIFO heirarchy. The collection of events stored initiated by the UNDO fucntion needs
to be returned where the earliest input be put back into order first down to the latest event triggered.



Programming Questions
You may program the following question in any language of your choice. Before you begin coding, write out a 
plan as to how you will solve the question.

1. Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".

```JS

function reverseString(str) {
  var splitString = str.split("");
  var reverseArray = splitString.reverse();
  var joinArray = reverseArray.join("");
  return joinArray;
}
console.log(reverseString('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQSTUVWXYZ'));

```

2. Implement the delete functionality of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the 
functionality of a LIFO data structure.

To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put them at the end of the 
queue, except for the last one which should be deleted and returned.

```JS

var arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
function stack(arr) {
  var rev = arr.reverse(); // [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
  var removeLast = rev.pop(); // [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2]
  return removeLast; // 1
}
console.log(stack(arr));

```
3. Fill in the methods for the following Queue class so that it will work as expected (FIFO).

```JS

var arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
function stack(arr,item) {
  arr.shift(); // [1]
  var addItem = arr.push(item); // [100]
  return arr; // [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,100]
}
console.log(stack(arr,100));

```
